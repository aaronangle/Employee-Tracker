# Employee-Tracker

This application allows the user to create and track a database of employees, roles, and departments for a company. The application is run on node and utilizes MySQL to store all the information. When the application is first run a prompt from inquirer is shown asking the user what they would like to do. Based on user input specific functions are triggered which take the user through each step of what they would like to do. You can view a video of the working application here:
